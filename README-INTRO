Hello y'all, in this repo we're gonna make some stats for some roller coasters from all around the globe, as I mentioned in the description.
It's a learning project, but I want to make things cristal clear, so everyone can understand what is written there.
It's a PYTHON 3.7.6 project, I'm using SPYDER 4, and I know - I know, but still win 7. I'm at the beginning of my coding journey, 
I'd like to become a data scientist one day... And, yeah, I'll try to make my scripts as close to perfection as possible, AND I WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY, IF SOME GUYS, WITH GREATER EXPERIENCE, WOULD JOIN IN :)

I started a course on CodeCademy few months ago, and at the end of a stage, or lesson, there was a project invitation, which was optional 
to take part in, and I started this on my own, to deepen my knowlege in Python and so on. And then I realised this project would be a nice 
first repo, or project for me here on GitHub too. So there in the project description, were some exercises one after another, and I started
doing tose, but soon realised, that this whole "project" on CodeCademy was kind of a quick job, so I extended it a bit, added extra issues,
extra thoughts to it, like you know, expanded roller coaster project, well absolutely just for fun, and learn. I'm definitely pleased by 
CC, huge help, absolutely, THX a lot!!! And, yeah, let's get started...
